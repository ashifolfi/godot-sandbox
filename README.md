# Project Sandbox
A project aiming to recreate the gameplay, graphics, etc. from source engine in godot.

## DISCLAIMER
Source Engine and the few example pieces of HL2 data (Gravity Gun Model + Textures) are property of Valve Software. No commercial use of these assets is allowed without permission of Valve Software. If any complaint is raised I will swiftly comply and remove the data, as it exists only for reference against Half-Life 2 to confirm accuracy to Source proper.
